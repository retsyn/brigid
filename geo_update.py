    topo_matching( source, target )

    Usage:
        Supply one mesh for "target" and another for "source".
        Will return true if the analysis matches.

    Purpose:
        Check if the topo of source matches the topo of target.

    Caveat:
        This is only checking point count, edge count, and vert count, very likely to be the same if topo matches.
        There can be no false negatives, but there is small potential for false positives.

    To Do:
        Find bpy alternative that does the same thing, if it exists.

        saves their former state to be re-instated later.

    Caveats:
        Must be used with /unmute_modifiers/.
